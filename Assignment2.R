# Assignment2: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()){
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function()x
  setInverse <- function(solve) inv <<- solve
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheInverse <- function(x, ...){
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)){
    message("getting cached data")
    retrurn(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setInverse(inv)
  inv
}
